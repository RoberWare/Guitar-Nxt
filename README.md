I made the guitar following these steps: http://www.nxtprograms.com/guitar/steps.html

And I added a base for standing, a motor for track how long will be the note and a button, just for feeling more comfortable while you're playing. Here's the result (More images inside project's folder): https://github.com/RoberWare/Guitar-Nxt/blob/master/Imgs/IMG_20170725_145056.jpg

You can play this guitar with the original programs that are programmed using NXT-G http://www.nxtprograms.com/guitar/steps.html#Program

Or you can use my program that is customizable using python.
<code>
python main.py
</code>

**Important**

Check the issues if you've got problems connecting the brick: https://github.com/RoberWare/Guitar-Nxt/issues/1
