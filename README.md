**Building

I made the guitar following these steps: http://www.nxtprograms.com/guitar/steps.html

And I added a base for standing, a motor for track how long will be the note and a button, just for feeling more comfortable while you're playing. Here's the result (More images inside project's folder): https://github.com/RoberWare/Guitar-Nxt/blob/master/Imgs/IMG_20170725_145056.jpg

You can play this guitar with the original programs that are programmed using NXT-G http://www.nxtprograms.com/guitar/steps.html#Program

Or you can use my program that is customizable using python.
<code>
python main.py
</code>

**Important**
If you've got problems connecting the brick: 

#Bluetooth
If you have problems pairing the brick maybe you have to pair the brick with your computer before running the program.
Just open the Bluetooth settings and pair with nxt, you'll need to write the same verification code in the brick.

#Usb
If you can't connect the brick using bluetooth try to connect the brick by usb to the computer.
If it doesn't work try to change the usb port.

#Anything works?
Try to turn on the nxt, have you got batteries?
